# üöÄ N8N Webhook Forwarder Project

A simple mini project built with [n8n](https://n8n.io) ‚Äî demonstrating how to receive a webhook and forward it to another API.

This project is designed as a learning exercise for automating workflows using **n8n**, version-controlling workflows in **Git**, and running everything locally without Docker.

## üß† Overview

This workflow does three things:

1. **Receives a Webhook** (`POST /webhook/my-event`)
2. **Forwards the request** to a test API ‚Äî [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)
3. **Returns a response** (`Received`) to confirm success

Workflow file: [`workflows/webhook-forwarder.json`](./workflows/webhook-forwarder.json)
